<p align="center">This project was created for the Advanced Mobile Application Development </P>
<p align="center">This is the backend to create a suitable software to store the important information of the vehicles owned by a person who buys and sells a vehicle </P>

## <h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>
<p align="center">Nisal is a student of the GDSE program of IJSE. His father buys and sells cars from all over the
country. He usually travels to many places in the country to find good vehicles to sell. A common
problem that he faces every now and then is that he would forget important information about
car deals and seller information. Since he sells cars that he buys within a short time like one
week, it is more likely for him to miss a few deals</P>
<p align="center">This situation has been happening quite a while and as a result his father lost a good amount of
very profitable deals</P>
<p align="center">Thus, Nisal decided to develop a mobile application for this scenario where he can store the car
details and images. Nisal plan to put this application up in Google play store and apple app store
for car sellers who has the same problem as his father</P>
